# Operators
An operator is a symbol that operates on a value to perform specific mathematical or logical computations. They form the foundation of any programming language. 
In C++, we have built-in operators to provide the required functionality.Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:

* Arithmetic Operators
* Relational Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Ternary or Conditional Operators

1) Arithmetic Operators:
a=8,b=3
a + b = 11 --> Addition --> +
a - b = 5 --> Subtraction --> -
a * b = 24 --> Multiplication --> *
a / b = 2 --> Division --> /
a % b = 2 --> Modulus --> %

2) Relational Operators

a == b is 0 --> Is Equal To
a > b is 1 --> Greater than
a >= b is 1 --> Greater than Equal To
a < b is 0 --> Less Than 
a <= b is 0 --> Less Than Equal To
a != b is 1 --> Not Equal To

3) Logical Operators

a && b is 1 --> AND --> &&
a || b is 1 --> OR --> |
!b is  0 --> NOT --> !

4) Bitwise Operators

a & b is 4 --> Bitwise AND
a | b is 6 --> Bitwise OR
a ^ b is 2 --> Bitwise XOR
a<<1 is 12 --> Bitwise Left Shift
a>>1 is 3 --> Bitwise Right Shift
~(a) is -7 --> Bitwise NOT

5) Assignment Operators

a = 6 --> Assignment Operator
a += b is 10 --> Add and Assignment Operator
a -= b is 6 --> Subtract and Assignment Operator
a *= b is 24 --> Multiply and Assignment Operator
a /= b is 6 --> Divide and Assignment Operator

# EXPERIMENT NO: 1

AIM: SET and RESET a value
Theory: We can binary AND and OR operator to SET and RESET a value
ALGORITH:

--> STEP 1: START
--> STEP 2: Declare and initialize a variable of type int
--> STEP 3: Use Binary AND and OR
--> STEP 4: Print the output
--> STEP 5: STOP

# EXPERIMENT NO: 2

AIM: Application of Left and Right shift
Theory: We can binary Left and Right shift operator 
ALGORITH:

--> STEP 1: START
--> STEP 2: Declare and initialize a variable of type int
--> STEP 3: Use Binary Left and Right shift operator
--> STEP 4: Print the output
--> STEP 5: STOP
